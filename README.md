MCP,

You should use my custom MCP, its already decompiled. Download: http://www.mediafire.com/download/3ttzqk9hmbwb8wb/Starcraft-MCP-V0.0.4.rar


Starcraft,

If the github download only had the folder called SRC just empty the contents from src/minecraft into my custom mcp, Starcraft-2/src/minecraft. If there are assets and common contents of both assets and common go in src/minecraft.
