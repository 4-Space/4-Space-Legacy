===========

Galacticraft,
You could use the Galacticraft dependencies insted and get the same coding results. Galacticarft SRC can be found here - 

https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft - To develop on the addon download Micdoodle core from here - http://ci.micdoodle8.com/job/Galacticraft/ 

- and place it in the mcp/jars/mods and download the regular version. Contents of assets and common go in src/minecraft.

Starcraft,
If the github download only had the folder called SRC just empty the contents from src/minecraft into your mcp/src/minecraft. If there are assets 

and common contents of both assets and common go in src/minecraft.

Contributors,
