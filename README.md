Development
===========

First before you even begin attempting to develop on this mod make sure you have followed the steps as follows. First download the latest java development kit for your computer and install JDK. Then download the latest standard eclipse and unzip to a preferred location. 

Once you have completed those steps you should download my latest customised MCP and unzip to a preferred location. Its comes alredy decompiled and includes galacticraft, micdoodle8 core and all of the dependency's. This is a rar file so you will need to unzip it with winrar or 7-zip. 

Then download the files from the github source. And then just empty the contents from src/minecraft into my custom mcp, 4-Space/src/minecraft. If there are assets and common contents of both assets and common go in src/minecraft.
